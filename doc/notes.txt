My notes:
Do i want a get that returns its friends via foreign key?
How to make sure my database has no dead rows?
I could also not keep django generated files in my source
Tests

Known bugs:
/import: ten import bezi poho np aj ked som ten id field override vymazal vsade?
	 aj odmazat by sa to dalo (je to zakomentovane)
	 when data is inserted REST should respond with the data. But because i also do update on import/, 
	 sometimes there is duplicate items in the same response
